# ISLP

I am currently reading An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R ("ISLR" for short). It's a great practical introduction to machine learning. This repository is my personal attempt to "translate" as much code as I can into Python as I go along. I have fancifully replaced the R in ISLR with P to reflect the change in language.

The repository is built into different sections and exercises. I am not providing solutions to any conceptual exercise question, but will provide the Python code for answers. I will include any relevant concept or rationale as comments within the code.
