**What is ISLP?**

An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R ("ISLR" for short) is a great practical introduction to machine learning. This repository is my personal attempt to "translate" as much code as I can into Python as I go along. I have fancifully replaced the R in ISLR with P to reflect the change in language.

The repository is built into different sections within the R Lab and exercises. I am not providing solutions to any conceptual exercise question, but will provide the Python code for answers. I will include any relevant concept or rationale as comments within the code.  

**How is this repository arranged?**

This repository is divided into chapters. Each chapter is divided into two subfolders - 
1. **R Lab:** This contains Python Codes from the R Labs section. These are marked according to the relevant sections. Therefore, a file named 3.6.3.py means it contains code from Section 3.6.3 of the R Lab (within Chapter 3).
2. **Applied Exercises:** This contains Python Codes from Applied Exercises from each chapter. The Applied Exercises will contain some sub-questions which ask the reader to interpret the model rather than code it. I will provide solutions to those questions for the sake of completeness.
