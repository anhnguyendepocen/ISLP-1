# ISLP

**What is ISLP?**

An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R ("ISLR" for short) is a great practical introduction to machine learning. This repository is my personal attempt to "translate" as much code as I can into Python as I go along. I have fancifully replaced the R in ISLR with P to reflect the change in language.

The repository is built into different sections within the R Lab and exercises. I am not providing solutions to any conceptual exercise question, but will provide the Python code for answers. I will include any relevant concept or rationale as comments within the code.  

**How is this repository arranged?**

This repository is divided into chapters. Each chapter is divided into two subfolders - 
1. **R Lab:** This contains Python Codes from the R Labs section. These are marked according to the relevant sections. Therefore, a file named 3.6.3.py means it contains code from Section 3.6.3 of the R Lab (within Chapter 3).
2. **Applied Exercises:** This contains Python Codes from Applied Exercises from each chapter. The Applied Exercises will contain some sub-questions which ask the reader to interpret the model rather than code it. I will provide solutions to those questions for the sake of completeness.

**Table of Contents**
1. [Chapter 3: Linear Regression](https://bit.ly/2VsS4cL)
2. Chapter 4: Classification
3. Chapter 5: Resampling Methods
4. Chapter 6: Linear Model Selection and Regularization
5. Chapter 7: Moving Beyod Linearity
6. Chapter 8: Tree-Based Methods
7. Chapter 9: Support Vector Machines
8. Chapter 10: Unsupervised Learning

**Notes**
1. The codes start at Chapter 3 because the Chapter 1 contains no code and the Chapter 2 is a basic introduction to coding in R, which has simple translations in Python. However, in my opinion, Chapter 2 is perhaps the most important chapter in the book since it explains the most important concepts of statistical learning (such as bias-variance tradeoff) which apply to all of the book irrespective of the model you choose to apply.
2. I have included both Python files (.py) and Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) in Chapter 3. This is primarily because I was not initially aware that I could upload Jupyter Notebbook files on Github. So, I copied and pasted all code (not the comments) from Python files to the Jupyter Notebook files. I did not copy the comments because they will need some formatting for which I am a little pressed for time at the moment. I have kept the Python files there since the comments are important for any reader wanting to gain a detailed understanding of my code. 
3. I will include only Jupyter Notebook files from Chapter 4 onwards, since they make for a better presentation). These Jupyter Notebook files will contain all comments unlike Chapter 3. I will update the Jupyter Notebook files with formatted comments for Chapter 3 in the near future.
